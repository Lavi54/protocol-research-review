1/ In response to the gauge request made by @AngleProtocol & @Monerium, we decided to shed light on the e-money regulation and a new stablecoin developed by @Monerium.

2/ Monerium is regulated as an electronic money institution (EMI) for the issuance of e-money. This means that it must meet certain regulatory requirements, such as over-collateralization, segregation of own funds and reserves and other safeguarding requirements.

3/ Users can register with Monerium to receive a personal IBAN and then fund it to receive EURe on their on-chain wallet. They can also off-board EURe by sending it from their on-chain wallet to an IBAN, which burns the EURe directly from the wallet.

4/ As part of our review we identified two centralization vectors in the smart contracts that could allow for infinite mints of EURe. We brought this to the attention of the Monerium team and they have committed to address these issues.

5/ Overall, we're excited about the potential of regulated stablecoins like EURe and look forward to seeing how Monerium continues to innovate in this space. Follow @Monerium for updates on their progress.
