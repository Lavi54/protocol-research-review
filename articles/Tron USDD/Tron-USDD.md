# Abstract

USDD is the stablecoin of the TRON ecosystem. Initially, USDD was launched as an algorithmic stablecoin. A copycat of Terra’s UST. After the collapse of UST and Terra, however, USDD pivoted to an over-collateralized stablecoin model.

USDD is minted by the Tron DAO Reserve (TDR): A group of seven whitelisted institutional members that can issue USDD by depositing collateral. Currently, the only accepted collateral is Tron’s native token TRX. Besides the collateral, the TDR also built up reserves in other currencies such as BTC, USDT, and USDC. The TDR has full control over all relevant smart contracts, including the minting of new USDD and the custody of the collateral and reserves.

Since its inception, USDD struggled to keep its peg at the one Dollar mark. For the most time, it traded several percentage points below the peg.


## A quick TL;DR of our findings:

* USDD is an over-collateralized stablecoin natively issued on the TRON blockchain. Initially launched as a copycat of UST, it pivoted to an over-collateralization model shortly after Terra’s crash. In comparison to other stablecoins such as DAI, however, USDD is not permissionless or decentralized.
* The stablecoin can only enter circulation via a 5-of-7 multi-sig, controlled by the seven whitelisted members of the Tron DAO Reserve (TDR). To issue new USDD, TDR members need to deposit TRX as collateral. The TDR has full control over all smart contracts, custody of collateral and reserves, and minting of new USDD.
* Currently, the circulating supply of USDD is at $725M. This number hasn’t changed since early July 2022. The TRX that is backing the circulating USDD only accounts for 85% of its value. However, the TDR has added reserves in BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The collateral and reserves together account for a collateralization ratio of over 160%. Around 65% of the total backing is in Tron’s TRX though.
* Besides over-collateralization, USDD has two additional stability mechanisms. A Peg Stability Module (PSM) and four Monetary Policy Instruments (MPI). However, USDD has been trading below the one Dollar peg for most of its existence. This has left the PSM empty (i.e no funds to trade against) and unusable.
* Most of the stability mechanisms and attempts to stabilize the price, are of “symbolic value”. Other measures that would have a direct impact on the USDD price are rare. There is no sign that collateral or reserves were used to directly impact USDD’s price.
* USDD also stands out because it repeatedly expresses false and imprecise statements. For instance, it prides itself to be “the first over-collateralized and decentralized stablecoin”. Not a single word in this sentence is true. Another example is the designation of the so-called “BurnContract”, which in reality is just a multi-sig holding the TDR collateral.
* In terms of technical security, USDD has undergone several audits by SlowMist. All the major components were assessed. There is also an active bug bounty program.
* There are no known activities that would point toward decentralized governance. There’s no forum or other venue to get involved, there’s no voting or on-chain governance. The team behind USDD is also unknown. But it’s obvious that Justin Sun plays a role in this project.


# USDD - Introduction

Decentralized USD (USDD) is the stablecoin of the TRON ecosystem. It was launched on [May 5, 2022](https://www.theblock.co/post/145231/trons-new-stablecoin-usdd-goes-live). USDD is issued by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR), which acts as custodian. Initially, it was launched as an algorithmic stablecoin. In many ways [similar](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/revolution-promised-by-trons-justin-sun-looks-like-clone-of-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin/) to Terra UST. As with UST, the plan was to incentivize USDD with a 30% APY. And like Luna for UST, Tron’s native token TRX would serve as [collateral](https://medium.com/coinmonks/new-algorithmic-stablecoin-usdd-promises-30-apy-is-this-a-terra-ust-copycat-2d2787af14b2) for USDD. After Terra's collapse, however, USDD pivoted to an over-collateralized stablecoin model, with some elements of rehypothecation.

Another differentiation factor is that USDD’s issuance is permissioned. Only whitelisted members of the Tron DAO Reserve are able to mint new USDD. Current [members](https://tdr.org/#/) of the TDR include Poloniex, Multichain, and Amber Group among others. Now insolvent Alameda Research was the first member but is no longer listed.


# USDD as an Asset

USDD is natively issued on the TRON blockchain. However, USDD is also available on Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. The cross-chain protocol BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) is used to transfer USDD from Tron to other chains. The BTTC [smart contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TU1CmpmWbCrFXqLLqMaKL2Q1d34bJNYLJe/code) is also the second largest [holder](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TPYmHEhy5n8TCEfYGqW2rPxsghSfzghPDn/holders) of USDD on Tron.

Further, USDD is enabled on a few DeFi applications. The most significant amount of TVL (~[$233M](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TX7kybeP6UwTBRHLNPYmswFESHfyjm9bAS)) is held by [JustLend DAO](https://app.justlend.org/?lang=en-US#/market). A borrowing and lending protocol on Tron. On Ethereum, USDD can be traded and deposited through a [Uni V3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c5c60bef00c820274d4938a5e6d04b124d4910b#tokentxns) or a [Curve](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe6b5cc1b4b47305c58392ce3d359b10282fc36ea) pool. Further, USDD is also traded on BNB’s [Pancake Swap](https://bscscan.com/address/0x004a9ce83614551271bcbd48e5fa3b8648dbe312).

When launching USDD, the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR) released $725M USDD from the initial smart contract. This was issued to TDR members, in return for depositing Tron’s native token TRX. During the first few weeks, over 8.9B TRX tokens were deposited by TDR members. That’s nearly 10% of the circulating TRX supply, worth ~$567M at the time of writing. Almost all funding came from one single [address](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TV6MuMXfmLbBqPZvBHdwFsDnQeVfnmiuSi) which is tagged as a Binance address.

As of today, the circulating supply hasn’t changed much. According to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/usdd), the circulating USDD supply is around $725M. Most of it is on Tron (~70%), around 17% is on Ethereum, followed by BNB with about 12%.

(Source: [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/stablecoin/usdd))

USDD is also enlisted on a handful of centralized exchanges. For instance, Poloniex, KuCoin, and of course Huobi ([Justin Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun), founder of the Tron network, is an advisor and investor at [Huobi](https://decrypt.co/112118/huobi-token-moons-the-week-justin-sun-becomes-exchange-advisor)).

And most recently, USDD became an officially [authorized digital currency](https://cryptoslate.com/tron-becomes-legal-tender-in-dominica/) and medium of exchange for the Commonwealth of Dominica. A small island developing state in the Caribbean. This is due to Mr. Suns' promotional activities. In late 2021, Justin Sun quit his role as CEO at Tron, to promote crypto adoption in developing states. He started from the Caribbean and became a WTO [diplomat](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-17/crypto-wunderkind-sun-says-he-s-becoming-a-diplomat-for-grenada) for the state of Grenada.


## USDD Issuance

There are two ways for new USDD to enter circulation. First, USDD can be issued by the seven members of the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). These whitelisted institutions can stake TRX, and withdraw USDD in return. Secondly, regular users can swap USDD for other stablecoins (e.g. USDT, USDC), via the Peg Stability Module (PSM).

At launch, the TDR pre-minted $999B of USDD. These sit in an “[issuance contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TRFGnuUqED3NDpMYgqZY1X3gAeVHNw1SDq)”. From there, $1B was transferred to an “[authorized contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TTsASxQhMk4t3S5vZMVVJ7nR2GQjDXNRnq)”. The TDR controls both contracts via a 5-of-7 multi-sig. Once in the authorized contract, TDR members and regular users can issue or swap USDD.


![docs-usdd-issuing-process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220379993-ae616d3a-2f4f-4069-bb06-51f6ec7aa761.png)


(source: [USDD Docs](https://docs.usdd.io/usdd-issuance/usdd-issuance))

**USDD issued by staking TRX (TDR members only)**:



1. TDR members deposit $TRX into the [TRX Burning Contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TNMcQVGPzqH9ZfMCSY4PNrukevtDgp24dK) (controlled by a 5-of-7 multi-sig).
2. The TDR calculates the dollar value of TRX on the prevailing exchange rate and transfers an equivalent dollar value of USDD from the [authorized contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TTsASxQhMk4t3S5vZMVVJ7nR2GQjDXNRnq) to the “circulation account” via multi-signature (5-of-7).
3. The TDR converts the [TRC10 USDD](https://tronscan.org/#/token/1004777/transfers) in the “circulation account” into [TRC20 USDD](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TPYmHEhy5n8TCEfYGqW2rPxsghSfzghPDn) and transfers the USDD to its member.

**USDD issued by swapping stablecoins (PSM)**:



1. The TDR releases the authorized and un-issued TRC10 USDD from the Authorized Contract to a [SafeVault Contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TMgSSHn8APyUVViqXxtveqFEB7mBBeGqNP) ([minter](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TUhQDzXJ3QsT6F2KiK5gZ3H673TV1516E9/code), [owner](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TPcnRbpuB89eKKkfH2E7iJooAqeEZPpdGb)) in the PSM.
2. When users swap other stablecoins for USDD, the PSM Contract converts TRC10 USDD in the SafeVault into TRC20 USDD and transfers it to users.

The Peg Stability Module supports USDD to keep its upside peg. In other words, if USDD trades above one US-Dollar, traders are incentivized to swap other stablecoins for USDD using the PSM. They can then sell USDD at another venue. Thus, making a profit and essentially bringing down the price of USDD back to one Dollar. However, the PSM is currently empty, after [USDD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdd) has not been trading above one Dollar in several months. As a result, there are no incentives to use the tool.

[Sidenote: USDD’s [documentation](https://docs.usdd.io/usdd-issuance/usdd-issuance) can be misleading, as the terms “staking” and “burn contract” are used for the same interaction. The “TRX Burning Contract”  is a deceptive designation. In reality, the TRX sent to the Burning Contract is not actually burned (i.e. removed from existence). On the contrary, the [Burning Contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TNMcQVGPzqH9ZfMCSY4PNrukevtDgp24dK) just stores the TRX. The “burned” TRX can always be redeemed by the TDR multi-sig. More on that later].


### Replenish the Reserves

Once the amount of USDD in the authorized contract falls below $500M, the TDR will automatically replenish the reserves. Therefore, the TDR simply releases more TRC10 from the Issuance Contract to Authorized Contract via multi-signature. After the transaction receives five out of seven signatures, the USDD will be locked for a minimum of 10 days.

As of today, the [Issuance Contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TRFGnuUqED3NDpMYgqZY1X3gAeVHNw1SDq) still holds $997.9B USDD, meaning that $1.1B USDD has been released to the [Authorized Contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TTsASxQhMk4t3S5vZMVVJ7nR2GQjDXNRnq/code).

Overall, the issuance of USDD has remained very constant. On-chain data and reports by Messari show that no new USDD was issued over the past six months.


![Messari-usdd-issuance-q4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220380087-cb83c9e3-58fe-4c5e-896c-cc53c83703fd.png)


(source: [Messari](https://messari.io/report/state-of-usdd-q4-2022?referrer=all-research))

The USDD supply has remained unchanged at around $725M. This suggests that demand for USDD did not increase since its inception. This take is reinforced by a slow growth rate in user adoption, i.e. the number of wallets holding USDD stayed flat in the last quarter according to [Messari](https://messari.io/report/state-of-usdd-q4-2022?referrer=all-research).


## Collateral backing USDD

USDD is promoting a high collateralization ratio (CR) on its website. At the time of writing, the CR hovered around 170%. The total collateral is supposedly at $1.25B, with $725M USDD in circulation.


![usdd-website-total-collateral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220380284-5a46510f-8095-4af3-8b06-7dfe25c679f6.png)


(source: [Tron DAO Reserve](https://tdr.org/#/))

Moreover, USDD  proclaims that its stablecoin is backed by “multiple mainstream digital assets” like TRX, BTC, or USDT. To confirm this statement, the website lists all wallets that contain their collateral and reserves.

A quick look into those wallets shows that USDD is mostly backed by the TRX held in the burn contract. In addition, three reserve accounts hold extra TRX, BTC, jUSDC, and jUSDT (i.e. USDC and USDT deposited into JustLend). In summary, 65% of the total collateral and reserves consist of TRX. BTC makes up 27%, while USDC and USDT account for about 6%.

(source: [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LnNj2Jm9Dun4DMoKDfpTyIHy0JHTo2chxqGORZS49ek/edit#gid=135516406))

In total, $1.15B can be found by combining the collateral and the reserves (see table above). On its website, however, USDD highlights that $1.25B is collateralizing its stablecoin. A difference of ~$100M.

This difference stems from a false calculation on the [website](https://usdd.io/#/). Simply by using a different price for TRX. The calculation of the above table was based on the TRX price from [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron) ($0.0685). The USDD website on the other hand applies a higher price per TRX (~$0.0806). A difference of plus 17.6%.

Subsequently, the collateralization ratio (CR) is also not correct. Instead of 172%, the actual ratio is 159%. That’s including all the reserves. By only looking at the burn contract, the $725M outstanding USDD is backed by $616M worth of TRX. This resembles a CR of merely 85%.

In conclusion, USDD is well backed by several top-tier tokens. There is, however, a high concentration of TRX. In addition, some of the reserves are either staked or deployed to other Tron-based protocols (e.g. JustLend). Thus, increasing the composability risk and the dependency on the TDR to always be “on the watch”.


## USDD Cross-Chain

As mentioned earlier, USDD is supported on Tron, Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. For cross-chain transactions, USDD utilizes the BitTorrent network. BitTorrent (BTTC) is a [bridge](https://app.bt.io/bridge) for cross-chain expansion, which was bought by Justin Sun in 2018. It relies on a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism and multi-node validation. Currently, the BTTC network is secured by 12 [validators](https://app.bt.io/staking). Among them are Binance and Huobi (another investment of Justin Sun).

Comparing the amount of USDD on Ethereum and BNB with the amount in the BTTC bridge, it becomes evident that the USDD on the destination chains is not fully backed. For instance, the BTTC bridge for Ethereum contains  [$116M USDD](https://scan.bt.io/#/contract/0xb602f26bf29b83e4e1595244000e0111a9d39f62), according to Etherscan there is over [$124M USDD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0C10bF8FcB7Bf5412187A595ab97a3609160b5c6) on Ethereum though. A difference of ~7M USDD. The same is true for the Binance Smart Chain. While the BNB contract on the BTTC bridge contains: [$89M USDD](https://bttcscan.com/address/0x74e7cef747db9c8752874321ba8b26119ef70c9e), there is actually over  [$110M USDD](https://bscscan.com/token/0xd17479997F34dd9156Deef8F95A52D81D265be9c) on BNB. An even higher difference of over $21M. It’s not fully clarified where the remaining amounts are coming from, speculation is that they were transferred from a CEX.


## Peg Stability Mechanism

The initial plan for maintaining the peg was very [similar](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/04/revolution-promised-by-trons-justin-sun-looks-like-clone-of-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin/) to Terra’s UST. Mainly the following two stability mechanisms were planned:



* **Short-term Arbitrage** - USDD was to maintain its price around a dollar, using the basic algorithm of 1 USDD = 1 dollar worth of TRX. In this scenario, TRX had a similar role to LUNA and would have been burned/minted when swapping USDD.
* **Building up Reserves** - A $10B reserve should help to defend the peg. It was predicted that the TDR will [raise $10B](https://trondao.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-our-community-on-establishing-the-tron-dao-reserve-3eda495f07c2) worth of highly liquid assets within six to twelve months, starting from May 2022 (USDD release date). While Terra [stated](https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1483973126161842176) the same intentions, the $10B reserve did not become a reality.

However, as mentioned earlier, it never came to implementing the Terra-UST system. A few weeks after the UST crash, the TDR [launched](https://twitter.com/usddio/status/1554823567904149505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1554823567904149505%7Ctwgr%5E1b5ae4f96116046b953f2beb17f50a00fd9c1fa6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftronspark.com%2Ftrondao-psm%2F) the Peg Stability Module (PSM). A tool that enables users to swap between USDD and USDT, without slippage and fees. The PSM was supposed to serve as an additional stability mechanism, based on arbitrage activities. However, the PSM module is no longer active, because USDD is suffering from a negative peg-off for quite some time. The PSM can only protect USDD in case of an upside depeg (i.e USDD > 1 US-Dollar). In the current scenario, filling the PSM with “counter-swap” stablecoins would produce constant losses for the protocol.

(source: [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdd))

In addition to the PSM, the TDR put in place several [monetary policy instruments](https://docs.usdd.io/faq/what-monetary-policies-will-the-tdr-adopt-to-maintain-the-value-of-usdd) (MPI) to maintain USDD’s price stability. Below are the four main policy instruments applied by the TDR.



* **MPI 1: Setting the Interest Rate - **Setting interest rates is a mechanism often used to regulate the supply and demand of currencies and loans. TDR works with its partner institutions and protocols to set USDD’s benchmark interest rates and has the power to adjust the rate at any time based on market conditions. The initial benchmark interest rate for USDD is 30% and is slightly higher on platforms that recently listed USDD, all subsidized by the TDR to acquire new users and drive up its adoption.

    Interests for USDD holders are paid out in USDD issued by the TDR and credited to their accounts.

* **MPI 2: Open Market Operations - **Through Open Market Operations TDR performs expansion and contraction of USDD's “monetary base”, to stabilize its value (supply and demand balance). To keep the USDD price stable and pegged to 1$, the TDR buys or sells USDD and reserve assets (TRX, BTC, USDT, and USDC) on DEXs and CEXs.
* **MPI 3: Window Guidance - **The TDR has partnered with DeFi protocols (e.g. JustLend) and centralized exchanges (e.g. Poloniex, Huobi) to be able to more effectively control USDD, in case of major market turbulence. The mentioned partners have the possibility to limit or even temporarily pause the lending of USDD and TRX, in order to protect the "USDD monetary system” from short-sellers.
* **MPI 4: Mint-and-Burn - **TDR actively uses a mint-and-burn mechanism between TRX and USDD, to maintain USDD’s stability. Depending on the situation, the TDR also uses additional methods such as enabling or disabling the minting process, adjusting the mint-burn ratio, and imposing upper limits on daily minting and burning activities.

In conclusion, the TDR with its TRX collateral, reserves, and active monetary policy instruments is the only body and mechanism to keep USDD’s peg. As seen in the image above, this is not working perfectly. USDD has been off-peg since June 2022 and is struggling since, to get back to the one Dollar mark.


## Misleading Marketing

While conducting this report, it became evident that Tron and USDD repeatedly use false or misleading wording and designations, throughout their marketing and communications. Some examples are listed below (this list is not exhaustive).

**False Statements**



* USDD is obviously not the first over-collateralized and decentralized stablecoin (see image below). USDD first came into existence in 2022. Over-collateralized and decentralized stablecoins exist since 2016. Moreover, USDD is far from decentralized and with a CR of 85% not even over-collateralized.

    

![twitter-usdd-frontpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220380580-58334394-83fd-4ac1-ae82-a4cbd80fed4c.png)



 (source: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usddio))
    

* On the [website](https://usdd.io/#/), USDD promises multiple times to be decentralized, tamper-proof, and independent from centralized entities. This shows a very unique understanding of those designations, given that a 5-of-7 multi-sig, fully controls USDD. All of the key holders are centralized entities.

**Debatable Promises**



* Further, the promise of being “fully backed and over-collateralized by mainstream assets” is debatable. As eluded earlier, USDD is 65% backed by Tron’s native token TRX. Secondly, the actual “collateral” in the burn contract only adds up to a CR of 85%. The rest comes from reserves, which were voluntarily stacked up.
* In consequence, the promised CR is also a matter of perspective. The TRX deposited by the TDR is currently worth less than the outstanding USDD. The collateral is not very well diversified, and an above-market price is used to measure TRXs’ collateral value on the website.
* In its outdated [docs](https://docs.usdd.io/usdd-issuance/over-collateralization-and-transparency), USDD claims to have a CR of over 319%.

**Misleading Naming**



* As mentioned above, the TRX “staked” by the TDR to issue new USDD is not burned. Naming a simple multi-sig “burning contract” is misleading.
* One could argue that the TRX is not even staked. Staking would require that the assets are at risk of being slashed. And that stakers earn interest or rewards for putting their assets into a staking contract. Both do not apply to TDR members. They only deposited TRX into an account, to which they collectively have access.


# Risk Vectors


## Smart Contract Risk

All relevant components of the USDD tech stack have undergone an audit. All smart contract audits were conducted by SlowMist:

The [TRC-20 token audit](https://usdd.io/SlowMistAuditReport-USDDTRC20.pdf) did not find any issues. However, for the [ERC-20 token audit](https://usdd.io/SlowMistAuditReport-USDD.pdf), the report highlighted that the PREDICATE ROLE can mint an unlimited number of tokens. In response, the project team stated that PREDICATED_ROLE is completely decentralized and held by the governance contract of BitTorrent Chain. BitTorrent Chain is governed by [12 validators](https://app.bt.io/staking). At least some of the validators are either controlled (e.g. Huobi) or tightly connected (e.g. Binance) to Justin Sun.

The [TRX Burning Contract](https://usdd.io/MultiSigFundRaiser.pdf) also passed the audit without any significant issues. The auditors concluded: “_This is the MultiSigFundRaiser contract that contains the BaseMultiSigWallet section. MultiSig users can redeem their TRX tokens to mint and issue USDD. SafeMath security module is used, which is a recommended approach. The contract does not have the Overflow and the Race Conditions issue._” 

Further, Slowmist looked at the [Issuance Contract](https://usdd.io/MultiSigLocker.pdf), the [Authorized Contract](https://usdd.io/MultiSigAuthorizer.pdf), and the [PSM](https://usdd.io/SlowMistAuditReport-PSM.pdf). While the first two did not reveal any concerns. The audit report on the PSM module found five suggestion vulnerabilities. Three of them were fixed while two were ignored.


## Depeg Risk

Since it was launched, the USDD market price deviates under the dollar peg. The reason for this can be summarized by one word: “timing”. As mentioned, USDD was released shortly before the UST crash. Initially as a copy of Terra UST, with a peg design based on a dual-token model. In the aftermath of Terra’s crash, however, many algorithmic stablecoins were struggling. USDD even more so, because Alameda Research - who was also invested in UST and Terra - started to have liquidity issues. Back then, Alameda was still part of the TDR.

Despite USDD switching its stability mechanism from an algorithmic to an over-collateralized model, it still got hit hard after Terra’s downfall. The figure below shows the volatility of USDD over the past 12 months.


![tradingview-usdd-depeg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220380962-69913c0b-4172-40d5-932d-ed9346591f56.png)


(source: [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDDUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO))

It’s not perfectly proven what caused USDD’s depeg. However, the most named reasons are:



* (1) The UST crash, which left many algorithmic stablecoins with problems. Especially copy cats of UST.
* (2) In the aftermath of the UST crash, FTX and Alameda Research, got into liquidity problems. The depeg from November 8th was ascribed to them. Justin Sun [stated](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/637615e238e8b54c28f2a219/) that the depeg was caused by Alameda, as they sold USDD to cover liquidity at FTX. On-chain data shows that two whales caused a depeg, by selling large amounts of USDD for USDT and USDC via the Curve [USDD-3CRV](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-116/deposit) meta pool. This led to an imbalance (82.27% USDD share in the pool). The imbalance [continued](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/12/trons-usdd-stablecoin-hits-lowest-since-june/) for over three months. In terms of balance, the pool looks much better today.
* (3) The “bids to asks” ratio at the exchange Huobi was below one Dollar for almost four months. And the USDD price dipped again to ~$0.97 on January 6, 2023, as Huobi [announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-huobi-lay-off-20-staff-justin-sun-2023-01-06/?utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90Ssplxp4ox-c6QnYXD77LRkl03TkMD4VWmGvDL6pP89KqfnSqpOuDVmCSbPoqpAbQ1SYm)  that it was laying off 20% of its staff. That same day, Justin Sun [transferred](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-06/sun-moves-100-million-of-crypto-to-support-his-exchange-huobi?utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90Ssplxp4ox-c6QnYXD77LRkl03TkMD4VWmGvDL6pP89KqfnSqpOuDVmCSbPoqpAbQ1SYm)  $100M in USDC and USDT from Binance to Huobi, in a show of confidence.

In conclusion, USDD does not print a healthy image. On the contrary, it has failed to hold its peg since the start. Despite Justin Sun’s crusade to support the peg, Tron’s stablecoin has a hard time recovering from its bumpy start. Among other issues, one of the main problems is the stability mechanisms. It seems that Justin Sun and the TDR are not willing to sell off TRX collateral or any reserves, in an attempt to re-establish the peg. Instead, they continue the fill the reserves, trying to show confidence in their stablecoin. However, these actions only have a symbolic meaning. The assets in the reserve vault don’t impact USDD’s price directly. To cause an impact, the TDR and Justin Sun would need to put their money where it can directly re-establish the peg. For instance, into the Curve pool, by market buying USDD with its collateral, or by putting USDC or USDT into the PSM module, to name a few examples. On the other hand, through such actions, the TDR would indirectly admit that USDD is dependent on its manual interventions. Plus it would put their funds at risk, whereas nothing can happen to their collateral while in the TDR-controlled contracts.


## Custody Risk

All USDD reserve wallets, including the [TRX “Burning” contract](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TNMcQVGPzqH9ZfMCSY4PNrukevtDgp24dK/code), are under the control of a 5-of-7 multi-sig wallet. The signers are the seven TDR members, all institutional crypto companies. The TRON DAO Reserve consists of the following [members](https://tdr.org/#/):



* [Amber Group](https://www.ambergroup.io/) - a crypto finance service provider that facilitates liquidity provision, trading, and asset management services.
* [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/) - a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, based in the United States. Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron network, is invested in [Poloniex](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/12/despite-denials-tron-founder-confirms-investment-in-poloniex-crypto-exchange/).
* [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/) - a decentralized web3 infrastructure provider, that helps developers, decentralized applications, and stakers to interact easily with an array of blockchains.
* [Mirana](https://mirana.xyz/) - a venture, trading, and asset management firm.
* [Multichain](https://multichain.org/) - a cross-chain router protocol, that provides the infrastructure for arbitrary cross-chain interactions [see our previous [article](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/cross-chain-gauges-and-ecosystem) on Multichain].
* [FalconX](https://falconx.io/) - **an **institutional crypto trading platform, built for larger financial institutions.
* [TPS Capital](https://www.tpscap.com/) - a trading company that develops and deploys its proprietary trading algorithms, to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.

Honorable mention: Alameda Research was one of the first members to manage the Tron DAO Reserves. After its collapse, however, the TDR membership was given up.

## Collateral Risk

In the current state, the only “official collateral” is TRX deposited into the BurnContract. This accounts for a collateralization ratio of about 85%. Although the Tron DAO Reserve website promotes that USDD is additionally backed by BTC, USDC, and USDT, the situation is a bit more complicated.

All accounts that are supposed to contain USDD’s collateral and reserves are controlled by a 5-of-7 multi-sig. Hence, USDD holders have to fully trust the TDR to react adequately in the event of a significant depeg (see next section). In November 2022, the TDR [announced](https://twitter.com/trondaoreserve/status/1590691862813478912?s=20&t=Cqz8wokUlnQmmQT4GfqRGQ) that it will purchase $1B USDT to “safeguard the crypto market”. This was done by using USDC from the USDD reserves. According to the announcement, the funds were moved to a centralized exchange, making it more difficult to follow what the funds were used for. However, as seen in the image below, reserves backing USDD shrunk drastically in Q4, 2022.


![Messari-reserve-withdrawal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89845409/220381134-92a76b47-0bc2-4a17-95b9-cca9879091a2.png)


(source: [Messari](https://messari.io/report/state-of-usdd-q4-2022?referrer=all-research))

The BTC reserves are also under the control of the TDR members. In theory, those reserves will be used in case the USDD depegs. However, this would require swift coordination of the five signers. It’s unclear how effective this mechanism is in case of emergency. Further, USDC and USDT reserves are used for rehypothecation on JustLend, which carries an additional risk.


## Governance Risk

USDD is not controlled via decentralized governance. The stablecoin is not even permissionless. As eluded above, the TDR fully controls the issuance of USDD.

Everything else is handled by an unknown team. There’s no public information that points to the team behind USDD. Contacting them via Discord and email did not result in further insights. Hence, it can only be assumed that the team consists of Tron developers. And given Justin Suns’ communication, it is very likely that he’s also deeply involved.

In summary, USDDs well-being is fully dependent on an anon team, Justin Sun, and the seven TDR members. Plus of course, the 27 [super representatives](https://developers.tron.network/docs/super-representatives), that make up the Tron validators (i.e. block producers of the Tron blockchain).


# Conclusion

USDD shows every sign of a quickly spun-up copycat, that still hasn’t found its ideal setup. After an initial growth phase, the adoption in the wider ecosystem has slowed down, and the stablecoin is still struggling with problems from its bumpy start.

There are no attempts to decentralize any components. After over nine months of existence, the project is still centrally steered by an unknown team. There are no decentralized and permissionless elements, despite their marketing claiming otherwise.

The stablecoin does not print a confident image in terms of its stability. Nor regarding the measures to stabilize the price. Large sums of money are transferred, without any notice period, followed by a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trondaoreserve) announcement stating that it was done to “protect the crypto market”. However, most measures don’t directly impact the price. Leaving the impression of a hands-off approach, that hopes for symbolic effects, to not endanger the reserves (e.g. BTC, USDT, USDC).

From a technical perspective, it appears that the team takes security seriously. The project underwent relevant measures to reduce the risks of a hack. All audit reports are public and there were no issues of high severity found.

In summary, potential concerns regarding USDD are mostly based on non-technical issues. A long list of red flags such as the intransparent project operations, control by a whitelisted group of institutional insiders, false advertising, non-diversified collateral, anon team, as well as the 6-month long off-peg urge for caution.
