1/ @apedotfi is a stablecoin lending protocol built for the ApeCoin community.

But are BAYC and MAYC holders actually its primary users? And what are the risks?

2/ Ape Finance allows borrowing of $ApeUSD against $APE as collateral.

$ApeUSD is soft-pegged to the US dollar. And $APE is the only collateral that is enabled.

Ape.Fi operates a Curve Factory Pool, with $USDC and $FRAX as counterparty assets.

___

3/ The protocol applies a concept similar to Automated Market Operations (AMO), pioneered by Frax, to ensure liquidity and peg stability via a Curve factory pool.

The team behind Ape Finance regularly uses this mechanism.
___

4/  The team deploys ApeUSD (which is not borrowed) into Curve and regularly rebalance the factory pool.

They own most of the pool, which lets them farm $CRV, $CVX, and $FXS rewards.

This has worked to stabilize the peg, BUT…
___

5/ …as a result, the majority of ApeUSD in circulation is not backed by $APE.

When starting our research, the collateral ratio (CR) was around 40%, and even lower before that.

Recently (after contacting the team), the CR started to recover.
___

6/ Besides low backing, our investigation uncovered some other concerns:

Ape.Fi is controlled by anon developers via a 2-of-4 multi-sig.

Only one signer is a known ApeCoin community member. The other EOAs have no activity.
___

7/ The team has full control over all relevant smart contracts. They could rug their users.

There is no community involvement and no governance processes in place.

Their $APEFI token is not used for governance. It’s used for bribing incentivization to the factory pool though.
___


8/ Governance NFTs (as detailed in their docs) have not yet been issued.

~97% of the $APEFI token are still in their multi-sig. The distribution as defined in their docs has not taken place.

And…
___

9/ - Ape.fi has not been audited. According to the team, the first audit is underway.

The claim has yet to be substantiated. 

There is also no bug bounty program.
___

10/ In summary, Ape.fi has several attributes we consider to be high risk to users.

Concerns mostly stem from the centralized control by the anon team, the fact that they could rug users, and the unaudited core contracts.
___


11/ We recommend replacing the unverified msig owners with team members from Curve, Convex, and/or Frax.

Barring a good faith effort, we believe $ApeUSD does not meet the necessary criteria to have a Curve gauge.
