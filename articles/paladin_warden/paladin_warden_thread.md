2/7 The Paladin protocol allows users to lend the governance power of various governance tokens. Under the hood it works similar to classic lending protocols where tokens are pooled and lent for an interest rate determined by demand and supply.

---
3/7 To be able to cater veTokens, Paladin launched a different product line called "Warden". This was due to the fundamental differences between veTokens and classic gov. mechanisms, i.e. the inability to fully lend full gov. power.

---
4/7 In a nutshell, Warden boost allows the boosting element of veCRV to be rented/leased independently of the underlying voting rights.

---
5/7 Paladin's 2nd product is Warden Quest. It allows protocols to set a budget, duration, desired amount of votes, and a fixed price per veCRV for gauge vote weights. 

This distinguishes it from other protocols where an arbitrary amount can be deposited as a voting incentive.

---
6/7 As far as the Warden products are concerned, no noteworthy risks could be identified. Both products do not represent a veCRV derivative, but contracts that only manage the functional aspects of veCRV.

---
7/7 As for the risks regarding Paladin, these are mainly confined within the powers of the multisig. Since trust assumptions can be made by virtue of the reputation and public disclosure of the multisig participants, the risk can likewise be considered minimal.
